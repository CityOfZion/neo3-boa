Overview
========

The ``neo3-boa`` compiler is a tool for compiling Python files to the ``.nef`` format for usage in the
`Neo Virtual Machine <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/>`_. The latter is used to execute contracts on the
`Neo Blockchain <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/>`_.

The compiler supports a subset of the Python language (in the same way that a Boa Constrictor is a subset of the
Python snake species.)
